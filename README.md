# 8mb - by usy
A local browser based video compressor which targets 8mb videos by default

Uses ffmpeg.wasm! Therefore performance isn't great, but there is no server involved.

## Settings
- Force single threaded mode (multi threaded doesnt work in some browsers such as edge)
- Target file size
- Custom audio bitrate
- FFmpeg quality preset
